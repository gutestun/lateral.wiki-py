The first I remember of getting interested in neuroscience was when I was 13 and [went to see awakenings by my self when i was 13](./www/went%20to%20see%20awakenings%20by%20my%20self%20when%20i%20was%2013.md).   
   
The second major interest I took in it was when I at age 22 or so bought a 700 page text-book called "Neuroscience" (and read… well… some of it.)   
   
Here are some questions and topics are my current pathways into neuroscience:   
   
- Are drugs with [post-synaptic action safer than pre-synaptic action](./www/neuroscience/post-synaptic%20action%20safer%20than%20pre-synaptic%20action.md)?   
- [nootropics](/not_created.md)   
   
## Subtopics   
   
- [neuroanatomy](/not_created.md)   
- [neurotransmitter](/not_created.md)s   
   
## People   
   
- [Andrew Huberman](./www/Andrew%20Huberman.md)   
- Santiago Ramón y Cajal   
Mentioned by Huberman
