title: Feed My Dead Body to the Vultures
updated: 2021-01-30

My ideal burial would be to have my body chopped up into bits, then thrown to the vultures on the Tibetan highlands.   
   
I saw this on a documentary once. In actual real, living video. The culture is such that being a butcher is a bitâ€¦ frowned upon, since killing animals is not nice.   
   
Another job of the butcher was to take bodies out onto a stony hill, cut it in pieces and throw it to the vultures.   
   
For some reason I'd rather have my remains go in to the circle of life in this immediate way, out in the open, instead of rotting and being eaten by maggots.
