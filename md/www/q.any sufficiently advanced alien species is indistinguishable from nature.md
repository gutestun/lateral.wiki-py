This is the modification of Arthur C. Clarke's [q.any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic](./q.any%20sufficiently%20advanced%20technology%20is%20indistinguishable%20from%20magic.md) that made me think about [t.Problems With the Simulation Hypothesis](./t.Problems%20With%20the%20Simulation%20Hypothesis.md)
