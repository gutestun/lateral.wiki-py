## Types of  ADHD   
It's been agreed upon that we have three types of ADHD:   
   
- Inattentive   
- Hyperactive   
- Combined   
   
   
### Inattentive   
It is speculated that inattentive type is a different beast from hyperactive/combined: [Is the inattentive subtype of ADHD different from the combined/hyperactive subtype? - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19767592/)   
>The significant differences found between the ADHD/CH and the ADHD/I subtypes raise the possibility that the two may be separate disorders.   
   
This is the one I identify (self-diagnose) the most with.
