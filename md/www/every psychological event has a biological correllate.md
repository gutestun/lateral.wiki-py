>every psychological event has a biological correllate	   
   
Meaning every thought, process, trauma and event that happens to you mentally will have a biochemical effect, a consequence. Psychological trauma can, and will, change your neurochemistry. A tragic event can cause depression, with downstream effects on neurotransmitter release (cue [SSRI](/not_created.md)s to increase available [serotonin](/not_created.md)).   
   
Conversely, a biochemical event - or cascades thereof - can have a psychological effect. This is too obvious: Coffee perks you up, chamomile tea calms you down, as does valium, and chocholate does so again but in a different way.   
   
Further, I could get into the philosophy of mind → skip a step → skip a step → something-something free will → murky waters → mumble-mumble → the nature of consciousness.   
   
But I won't. Because [Mathew Johnson](/not_created.md) already said as much:
