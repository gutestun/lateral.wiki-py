>every psychological event has a biological correllate	   
   
Meaning every thought, process, trauma and event that happens to you mentally will have a biochemical effect, consequence. To greater and lesser extents, obviously. Psychological trauma can, and will, change your neurochemistry. A tragic event will be able to cause depression, with it's corresponding effects on neurotransmitter release.   
   
Conversely, a biochemical event can have a psychological effect. This might be too obvious… coffee perks you up, cammomile tea calms you down, as does valium, while chocholate goes so in a different way.   
   
Further, I could get into philosophy of mind → skip a step → skip a step → something-something free will → murky waters → mumble-mumble → the nature of consciousness.   
   
But I won't, because [Mathew Johnson](/not_created.md) already said so, in a Lex Fridman Podcast – where this quote is taken from – and he said it thusly.
