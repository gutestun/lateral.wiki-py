# Any Sufficiently Advanced Computer Is Indistinguishable From the Universe   
   
We begin with [q.any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic](./q.any%20sufficiently%20advanced%20technology%20is%20indistinguishable%20from%20magic.md), but if we move one level further, we go from *sufficiently advanced* **technology**, to what I think is equivalent to a *sufficiently advanced* **computer**, namely a *sufficiently advanced* **species**:   
[q.any sufficiently advanced alien species is indistinguishable from nature](./q.any%20sufficiently%20advanced%20alien%20species%20is%20indistinguishable%20from%20nature.md)
