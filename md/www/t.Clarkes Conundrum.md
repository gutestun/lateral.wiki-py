[q.any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic](./q.any%20sufficiently%20advanced%20technology%20is%20indistinguishable%20from%20magic.md) is a classic by Clarke. [anton petrov](/not_created.md) took it further and said that [q.any sufficiently advanced alien species is indistinguishable from nature](./q.any%20sufficiently%20advanced%20alien%20species%20is%20indistinguishable%20from%20nature.md).   
   
Whilst thinking about the [t.Problems With the Simulation Hypothesis](./t.Problems%20With%20the%20Simulation%20Hypothesis.md) a transposition of this origamied upon me:  [t.any sufficiently advanced computer is indistinguishable from the universe](./t.any%20sufficiently%20advanced%20computer%20is%20indistinguishable%20from%20the%20universe.md).   
   
Does this glue [GÃ¶del](/not_created.md) to [Alan Turing](/not_created.md) and negate the diff betwen *in-* and complete?
