ðŸš§This is mostly a reminder to my self to dig up that studyâ€¦ðŸš§   
   
Decisions are illusory, based on that experiment where the signals to initiate physical action were sent from the brain before the actual sense of consciously initiating it happened.   
   
Stumbled across this study a long, long time ago, and need to revisit.   
   
This also questions â€“ and opens â€“ the whole [free will](/not_created.md) hornets nest and supports my sorry intuition that [humans are automatons](./humans%20are%20automatons.md). Less grim is the connection to the buddhist practice of meditation and observing your thoughts as separate from Self.   
   
The sense of identifying with your thoughts dissolves, and the whole matter of [free will](/not_created.md) kind of dissipates a little. My experienceâ€¦
