Touching story, hard start at life. Basically became a hacker by necessity. Cries as he tells about his daughter, how it was the impetus for doing better than bagging groceries, wanted more for her.   
His mother died of alcoholism. Last night she lived she asked him how his computer studies were going. He lied and said they were going well. The morning after he pulled the covers off her, and… in his words: "there she was".

>helping people, helping others… you know, not doing things for yourself, doing things for others   
>To help people.. to help people, right? To help people achieve their goals, help people understand who they are, not just where they've been, understand the shit that they've seen but to help people understand how to get where they're going by telling them what I've been through, the shit I've been through.   
>You know, I've been through some serious shit in my life, but that has never deterred me from becoming who I am and who I expect to be.   
>And it really hasn't stopped me from helping others, and showing them the way.
