Refers to the common *misunderstanding* that the base of our brain is essentially equivalent to the brain of a lizard, and it's base emotional nature commandeers a lot of our doings here on earth.   
   
This is not the case.   
   
Even though the structures are similar and of identical origin does not mean that ours has remained unchanged.
