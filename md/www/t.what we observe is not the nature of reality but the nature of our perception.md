*What we observe is not the nature of reality but the nature of our perception*, andin some way we are prisoners in a hall of mirrors. A fractal, non-euclidean hall of mirrors.   
   
We see not the outside, but [the infinite fractal splintering of our self looking at our self](/not_created.md), which despite being self is [that which lies beyond our apparatus of cognition](/not_created.md).
