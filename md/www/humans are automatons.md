I have long thought that [t.what we observe is not the nature of reality but the nature of our perception](/not_created.md), and we can not fathom [that which lies beyond our apparatus of cognition](/not_created.md).   
   
Analogous to this is the fact that [every psychological event has a biological correllate](./every%20psychological%20event%20has%20a%20biological%20correllate.md). Flipside: [psychological actions can influence biochemistry](/not_created.md)
