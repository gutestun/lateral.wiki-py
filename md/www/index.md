## What's this then?   
My [Digital Garden](./Digital%20Garden.md) . Look at it as a hybrid between my loosely connected, private notes, learning in public and the type of website we had during the golden age of the internet (mid 90s) before overcommercialization, when people still posted their private thoughts for the whole world to read.   
   
Most of what you read here will be drafts. Most of them will never become finishedâ€¦ anythings. I [write to think](https://notes.mxstbr.com/Write_to_think).   
   
## A Couple Starting Points   
   
Some thoughts and opinions, a couple interests.   
   
### ðŸ§ ðŸ’ª [Strong Opinions Weakly Held](./Strong%20opinions%20weakly%20held.md)     
Change your mind, and change it often. Remember to use conditioner and fabric softener. Warranty voided.   
   
## Interests   
   
### ðŸŒŒ Cosmology   
I'd say physics, but only in the sense that the philosophical and existential implications that arise from the exploration of cosmology and quantum mechanics are physics.   
   
The further we reach into the concrete, hard, material world, the more it dissolves, spins (but not really, and it takes 720 degrees to go a full turn, not 360), turns inside out, does at least eleven improbable and strange loops (hello GÃ¶del) and pops up right in the very core of philosophy, startling everybody and pretending like nothing.   
   
[I will never understand reality](./I%20will%20never%20understand%20reality.md).   
   
A couple quotes by physicists might be in order at this point:   
[q.I do not like the word materialist because I dont think we know what material is](./q.I%20do%20not%20like%20the%20word%20materialist%20because%20I%20dont%20think%20we%20know%20what%20material%20is.md).   
   
   
### ðŸ§  [Neuroscience](./neuroscience/_moc-neuroscience.md)   
Which includes a wee bit of [psychology](/not_created.md) and [psychiatry](/not_created.md)   
   
A thought: [t.what we observe is not the nature of reality but the nature of our perception](./t.what%20we%20observe%20is%20not%20the%20nature%20of%20reality%20but%20the%20nature%20of%20our%20perception.md)   
A topic: [adhd](./adhd.md)   
A concept: [limbic friction](./limbic%20friction.md)   
   
## Other, top of mind topics and interests   
Important shit! Basically the exact same as [what i want my children to know](./what%20i%20want%20my%20children%20to%20know.md)   
   
- [Industrial literacy](./Industrial%20literacy.md)   
- [how to spot misinformation online](./how%20to%20spot%20misinformation%20online.md)   
- [50 Ideas That Changed My Life](./50%20Ideas%20That%20Changed%20My%20Life.md)   
- [Information Hazards](./Information%20Hazards.md)   
   
## Bliki   
Not a blog, not a wiki. But it's a blog...   
It's chronologically sorted small heapings of words.
