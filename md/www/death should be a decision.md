title: Death Should be a Decision
type: thought

I firmly believe that [death should be a decision](./death%20should%20be%20a%20decision.md). That belief was semented when [My Father Died](./My%20Father%20Died.md), and before that, when [My Maternal Grandfather Died](/not_created.md).   
   
Great inspiration here is [Terry Pratchett](/not_created.md) who was public about the dignity of – and right to – choose your own life's end. Especially when faced with degrading and debilitating circumstances.
