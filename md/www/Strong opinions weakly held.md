# Strong Opinions Weakly Held   
   
The idea that we should go with what we think, with our theories, our intuitions, but change them as soon – and quickly – as we encounter evidence to the contrary.   
   
Overcome confirmation bias.

## Strong Opinions That I Hold Weakly   
This is all pretty dire. Reading it over I wonder why I am not more severely depressed than I, in fact, actually am. I guess I don't hold any strong opinions about the sublime and transcendental. I have strong, intense experiences of them, but I try to not have opinions.   
   
Since we actually have to live with our selves and each other, no matter the substrate upon which whatever I "is" rests (more on that later):   
   
### Humaning and Co-Humaning   
Chill: [life is not about perfection - but making sure every delta is positive](./life%20is%20not%20about%20perfection%20-%20but%20making%20sure%20every%20delta%20is%20positive.md)   
Don't chill too much: [not doing drugs is more important than taking vitamins](./not%20doing%20drugs%20is%20more%20important%20than%20taking%20vitamins.md)   
Seriously; Your Chill is Blocking Other People: [keep moving and get out of the way](./keep%20moving%20and%20get%20out%20of%20the%20way.md)

### Parenting   
Just visiting co-mentors: [My kids are not mine and they are not kids](./My%20kids%20are%20not%20mine%20and%20they%20are%20not%20kids.md).

### Death   
Don't let me die in pain, in vain, or insane: [death should be a decision](./death%20should%20be%20a%20decision.md). It would be less painful, more meaningful.   
Let me re-enter the stream ASAP: [feed my dead body to the vultures](./feed%20my%20dead%20body%20to%20the%20vultures.md).   
   
### The Mystical and transcendent (also; religion)
