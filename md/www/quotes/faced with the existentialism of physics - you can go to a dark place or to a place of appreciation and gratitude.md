Pertains to how spectacularly unlikely, improbable *you*… *this whole, weird thing* is.   
   
This holds true for so, so many other thoughts and realisations.   
The particular thought this refers to is that [There is no fundamental notion of meaning in reality – There is no fundamental meaning of purpose – There is no fundamental meaning of value](/not_created.md)   
   
This whole perspective is the impetus behind my [bio.cosmological cry](/not_created.md)   
   
Funny how something that seems like nihilism can get you so close to gratitude, awe and bliss that borders on religiosity.
