I will never understand reality, because the maths behind modern physics (quantum field theory, cosmology in general) is way beyond me.   
   
Not only do I not know enough maths to appreciate the finer details – or even some "basic" concepts – but I don't see myself putting in/having the resources (time) to learn them.

I did see an article where author posits that generalists *can* understand enough in "foreign" fields to be useful, especially if/since they have a greater overview and can draw connections between fields that those deeply embedded would have a hard time seeing on their own.   
   
That gives me a little hope. A little...
