# Twenty Seven Zeroes Made Me Cry   
   
I recently watched Anton "*Hello beautiful people!*" explain in his youtube video that we might have twice as many galaxies in the universe as hitherto thought.   
   
Maybe even twice as many as that again. Had to check on the development, and it's not *two*, not *four* times as many, but **ten times as many galaxies in our universe as we thought**.   
   
That's up from 200 billion to 2 trillion. 2 000 000 000 000 000  â€“ fifteen zeroes. Our Milky Way galaxy might hold 200 billion stars, that's another 12 zeroes. 27 zeroes together. That's how many stars there *might* be.   
   
My tear ducts got active when I thought about that. There is not one christmas star. In 2020 I got 400 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 christmas stars.
