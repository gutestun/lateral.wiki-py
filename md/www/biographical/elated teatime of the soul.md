# Elated Teatimes of the Soul   
   
Prologue: [twenty seven zeroes made me cry](../../www/biographical/twenty%20seven%20zeroes%20made%20me%20cry.md)   
   
[Curt Jaimungal](/not_created.md) has talked about his... existential crises and mental destabilisation recently, as a result of him delving deep into the nature of reality.   
   
I feel that my tiny episode was not entirely dissimilar. But two orders of magnitude lesser, at least, and veering towards incredulous gratitude, and not "extreme discomfort" as with Curt.   
   
There was a moment where I was doubting my sanity in that moment, and if I would retain it in the future.   
   
He had a dark night of the soul, whilst what I experienced was an elated teatime of the soul.
