This might be some of the most important lesson to teach the people you know after 2020.   
   
When I grew up I was lucky to be [almost a third culture kid](/not_created.md), in the sense that my german father, when we lived in Norway, taught me that the blind trust in NRK (state television) and general naivete of the Norwegians was… not *only* naive, but potentially dangerous.
