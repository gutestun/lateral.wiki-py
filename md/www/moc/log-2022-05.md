## Digital Gardens   
*Some digital gardens I found and enjoyed*   
### [Chloe's Digital Garden ðŸª´](https://garden.chloeabrasada.online/)   
   
### [Bianca's Digital Garden ðŸ§ ](https://garden.bianca.digital/)   
It's one of those nice gardens where you don't realise it's depth before you go peruse and your perusal turns into this long trek into a jungle where you cut your way with a machete. It's one of those where I wish my trail could be saved, and if it were it could probably be to profile my personality.   
   
I also appreciate how tidy the notes are, and probably the best typography I've seen in a [digital garden](/not_created.md).. Seems to be using Jekyll.   
   
The thickets I slashed my way through were about design, learning, self development.
