Not doing drugs is more important than taking vitamins.   
   
Not eating unhealthy is more important than adding vitamins to your unhealthy diet.   
   
The negative effects are not negated, and the benefits won't outweigh the negatives. Quitting something bad will have a greater impact for the better than adding something good.   
   
Mostly because the bad you are trying to quit often is far more destructive than any one, good habit will be good for you.
