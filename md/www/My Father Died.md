Early in 2020. Many, many many-many years ago I promised him to assist him should his health and quality of life deteriorate to the point where we both would have agreed that enoughâ€¦ enough is enough.   
   
I never (had to) / (brought up the courage to) do so. Licensed palliative medical staff came to our home, held his hand when my mother, my sister and I took a little break. When they did not tend to our emotional needs they moistened his lips and saw to it that the bag of saline solution with morphine in it kept flowing and kept my father under.   
   
They, the Norwegian state, made the death process of my father a little less painful for him.   
   
It could have been even less painful, and more meaningful if [death was a decision](./death%20should%20be%20a%20decision.md).   
   
## Retrospect   
### 2021-01   
The timing wasn't bad. He had such anxiety induced by his shortness of breath, that experiencing the pandemic would have killed him by fear.   
I wish he could have seen the political upheaval in the world, though, especially USA. So many things he talked about for years have come to pass.   
   
### 2022-05   
He should have seen the Ukraine and Russia thing.   
He also should have seen his grandson. I'll make sure to speak of him with the same reverence and respect as he did of my grandfather, whom I never met.
