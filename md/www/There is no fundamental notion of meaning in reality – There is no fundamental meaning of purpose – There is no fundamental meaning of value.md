I agree. "Meaning" is a language construct our primate brains have evolved. And that's – more or less, probably – the level at which that concept exists. But here's the thing: That does not make it any less real, less important, less trancendent, less… dare I say; spiritual or godly.   
   
Here I am in danger of being anthropocentric, but I believe some things are *just human* and nothing more, nothing less. And that's enough. It's fine. This is where we live. This is our world. Forget the infinitesimal and eternal for a moment.   
   
Our thoughts, concepts, dreams, hopes… they need not reach that far beyond our selves. They may not be able to reach beyond our selves *at all*… they may be *part of*, or the very essence *itself* of our selves.   
   
If there is such a thing as… no scratch that… if there is something *like* purpose, meaning outside of, independent of, larger than humanity, then we might not be able to conceive of it. It might not be recognizable to us. Ever.   
   
Then Greene goes on to say (paraphrased):
