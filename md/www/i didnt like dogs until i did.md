# I have a confession: I am a dogist.   
2022-05-06   
   
Rewind!   
   
Cats. That's where it's at. Everybody wishes they were a cat. An aristocat. My cat's name - in Norwegian - is Dignity.   
   
Dogs have no dignity.   
   
The dogs in my life, well, there was only one. My sister's. It was tiny. It was white. We called it an inside-out mitten. It's name was Terror.   
   
Named after a cat.   
   
Today, though. Today I dogsat for my sister. Not for Terror, he died many years ago, after being a confused, old man with dementia, bless his tiny, fluffy, white, annoying heart.   
   
I dogsat Rikke, an American Bulldog, and her eleven offspring.   
   
She had 11 puppies three weeks ago, and today I am wringing my brain to come up with a way to steal one of the 1.700â‚¬ puppies.   
   
I am a believer now. In puppy therapy. In dogs.   
   
   
I now like dogs.   
Some dogs.   
The dogs in *my pack*.   
   
I am a dogist.
