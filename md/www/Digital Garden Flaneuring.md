### Flaneuring the Garden   
I think flaneuring describes how I explore digital gardens best.   
   
It is also how digital gardens are intended to beâ€¦ processed, to use a far less organic word. At least it seems to be the trend.   
   
Is this too urban and technical terminology? It's causing some cognitive dissonance to reconcile "digital" and "gardening". But I'm trying by [flaneuring the wilderness](./The%20best%20digital%20garden%20retains%20a%20sense%20of%20wilderness.md).
