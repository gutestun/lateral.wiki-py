# Strong Opinions Weakly Held   
   
The idea that we should go with what we think, with our theories, our intuitions, but change them as soon – and quickly – as we encounter evidence to the contrary.   
   
Overcome confirmation bias.     
   
## Strong Opinions That I Hold Weakly   
This is all pretty dire. Reading it over I wonder why I am not more severely depressed than I, in fact, actually am. I guess I don't hold any strong opinions about the sublime and transcendental. I have strong, intense experiences of them, but I try to not have opinions.   
   
   
- Addiction: [most addicts are trauma survivors](./most%20addicts%20are%20trauma%20survivors.md)   
- Misunderstood: [hackers are ethical](./hackers%20are%20ethical.md)   
   
### Society Sucks   
   
- Most people are wrong: [the majority is never correct](./the%20majority%20is%20never%20correct.md)   
   
   
### Death   
   
- Let me re-enter the stream ASAP: [feed my dead body to the vultures](./feed%20my%20dead%20body%20to%20the%20vultures.md)   
   
   
### The Human Condition   
Mostly consciousness and epistemology, and - i realise - a lot about free will, and the probable lack thereof. Also, solipsism.   
   
   
- [q.I think we should have Existential crises all the time, I think it's good for the soul - Brian Greene](./q.I%20think%20we%20should%20have%20Existential%20crises%20all%20the%20time%2C%20I%20think%20it%27s%20good%20for%20the%20soul%20-%20Brian%20Greene.md)   
   
#### Resistance is Futile   
   
- Beautiful Emptiness: [There is no fundamental notion of meaning in reality – There is no fundamental meaning of purpose – There is no fundamental meaning of value](./There%20is%20no%20fundamental%20notion%20of%20meaning%20in%20reality%20%E2%80%93%20There%20is%20no%20fundamental%20meaning%20of%20purpose%20%E2%80%93%20There%20is%20no%20fundamental%20meaning%20of%20value.md)   
   
#### Recursion (also: Free Will, hahaha)   
   
- Never Entirely Right: [t.everything in the brain is an abstraction](./t.everything%20in%20the%20brain%20is%20an%20abstraction.md)   
- Forever on the Cusp of  Complete Understanding: [t.humans are interesting because you can just barely understand them](./t.humans%20are%20interesting%20because%20you%20can%20just%20barely%20understand%20them.md)
