Something inbetween a blog, personal notes, twitter and‚Ä¶ Actually, you know what? It's exactly what the internet ‚Äì personal websites ‚Äì used to be in the 90s.   
   
## What Digital Gardens Are to Me   
   
   
For me it is also a way of revisiting memories. As they bubble up, I write them down, which makes space for new (err‚Ä¶ older) bubbles to float to the surface, where I again catch those, and encase them in the beautiful, glowing, warm amber of‚Ä¶ cold clean digital text‚Ä¶   
   
It's a cozy and comforting way to rummage through ones damp, dark, sharply edged and metallic memory conduits. Usually there's rust and leaking fluids as well. Not the clean Jeffrey Tubes of [tng](/not_created.md).   
   
A core tenet of digital gardening is to forget perfectionism. Your flowers will get pests, your fruit trees will be crooked, snails will eat your flowers, deer will feast upon your berries. A perfectly manicured garden is not what a garden is for. A perfectly manicured garden is obsesion ‚Äì a garden is for play, relaxing, having shower thoughts.   
   
### The Best Digital Garden Retains a Sense of Wilderness   
A good digital garden graph should be well-connected, but not too much. There should be dead ends, alleyways from which you can only escape by retracing your steps. You *should* get lost. You should *have* to retrace your steps.

As my wife and I decided after buying a house with a well-kept garden: It is for children to play in. For neighbours and friends to eat barbequeue and drink white wine in. And occasionally to enjoy the breeze while pissing on an apple tree.

### Flaneuring the Garden   
I think flaneuring describes how I explore digital gardens best.   
   
It is also how digital gardens are intended to be‚Ä¶ processed, to use a far less organic word. At least it seems to be the trend.   
   
Is this too urban and technical terminology? It's causing some cognitive dissonance to reconcile "digital" and "gardening". But I'm trying by [flaneuring the wilderness](./The%20best%20digital%20garden%20retains%20a%20sense%20of%20wilderness.md).

## Digital Gardens in the Wild   
   
There's heaps of references to the woman that draws, the guy with the manifesto, the guy with not a blog, and the guy that **everybody** links to with the horizontal web interface gimmick(\*)   
Here's some things I found below the surface:   
   
- [Why Bother?](https://salman.io/blog/why-bother/) by Salman ‚Äì On why to bother, which I have wondered regarding my notes in [sw.obsidian](/not_created.md). Is it worth it?   
- [Mind Garden Benefits: üå±üå≤ üå± Nurse Log Notes ‚Äî a mind garden planted by c wess daniels](https://cwdaniels.github.io/index.html)   
	The benefits are myriad. Mine currently ‚Äì after about 9 months (as per 2020-12) after having learned of the term digital garden ‚Äì is that my mind constantly prowls the thoughts that surface throughout the day for connections to other thoughts and concepts I hold.

### Digital Gardens and Information Design   
There seems to be an overlap of digital gardeners and information systems design people. A lot of articles about how to design information interfaces, the future of the web, wistful articles about Project Xanadu and how we have fucked up and deviated from the original vision of hypertext.

### Three sources   
[This post](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden), by **Joel Hooks** in 2016, is considered the ‚ÄúManifesto‚Äù by many digital gardener, even thought there are precursors like **The Garden and The Stream**, by Mike Caulfield in 2015 ([link](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/)), and even the 1998 **Hypertext Gardens** by Mark Bernstein ([link](http://www.eastgate.com/garden/Enter.html)).
