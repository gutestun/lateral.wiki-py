title: Keep Moving and Get Out of the Way
updated: 2021-01-01

Pertains to living in a city, where you avoid stopping in the middle of the street, subway station, escalator, sidewalk…    
   
Anywhere.   
   
To help life move along as smoothly as possible for everybody; *keep moving and get out of the way*.   
   
>One can not only get out of the way of others. An active perception and proactive mobility is required.
