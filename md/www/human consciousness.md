By "human consciousness" I mean not how consciousness arises, what the nature of it is, but the limits of human perception and thought.   
   
For example:   
[t.humans are interesting because you can just barely understand them](./t.humans%20are%20interesting%20because%20you%20can%20just%20barely%20understand%20them.md)
