# elated teatimes of the sould   
   
First read [j.twenty seven zeroes made me cry](/not_created.md), then this:   
   
[Curt Jaimungal](/not_created.md) has talked about his... existential crises and mental destabilisation recently, as a result of him delving deep into the nature of reality.   
   
I feel that my tiny episode was not entirely dissimilar. But two orders of magnitude lesser, and veering towards incredule gratitude, and not "extreme discomfort" as Curt says.   
   
There was a moment where I was doubting my sanity in that moment, and if I would retain it in the future.   
   
He had a dark night of the soul, whilst I had a dark tea-time of the soul.
