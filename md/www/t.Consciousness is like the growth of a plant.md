## Consciousness is like the growth of a plant     
   
Nowhere can you say that soil turned into a living being, but the process nonetheless transmutates the inert matter into a living being.   
   
I had this thought while looking at one of my climbing plants that flows along a couple strings strung up beneath my living room ceiling. While watering it, I thought about how a plant is not a thing, but a process of becoming, becoming, becomingâ€¦ Growing, growing, seeding, dying, becoming yet again through the seeds.
