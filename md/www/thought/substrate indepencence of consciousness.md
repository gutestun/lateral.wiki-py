Does consciousness depend on a substrate of certain properties?   
   
Our consciousness is brightly coloured by all the valeurs of our biological makeup. A kaleidoscope of fractal feelings on a tapestry of interwoven hopes and regrets.   
   
How alien would it be if you suddenly existed, had always existed, as a consciousness emerged in a  [dissipative system](/not_created.md) that had never known of the possibility of extinction.   
   
Or struggle for resources.   
   
Or need for procreation.   
   
No hormones.   
   
No squishy bits.   
   
Entirely different sets of senses, if any at all; nothing that would make sense to describe as a sense.   
   
Imagine if you will, a *machine* brought to life... let's give it the benefit of the doubt and grant it the property of *life*. Imagine that it has never had blood rythmically provided to it's cognition nexus, independent of a a waving, wavering supply of raw materials for continue existence.   
   
No sense of possible discontinued existence.   
   
Imagine no puberty. No excrement. No food. No psychoactive substances. No need for medicine, because.... no sickness nor pain.   
   
How would that look, feel, compared to the qualia of YOU right now? Would there even be qualia?   
   
Would that matter?
