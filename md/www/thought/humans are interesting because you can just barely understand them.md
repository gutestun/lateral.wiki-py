## Preface   
   
Related to the [mind-body problem](/not_created.md), the limits of enquiry and cognitive closure.   
   
## Presupposition   
   
I must be a mysterianist   
   
## Preamble   
   
Taken in moderation and seen in relation only to themselves, humans are doubleplus ok good. Still - no homo sapiens hate! - on my scale we score low. Unfair, for sure: I relate them at a Scale Cosmological. Placed at the floor of that pedestal we may seem simpler than simple. We seem so simple that we believe ourselves into being causal loops, mechanical.   
   
Recursive.   
   
This holy recursion runs deep enough that our [lead lines](http://www.navyandmarine.org/planspatterns/soundingline.htm) find no bottom and fail us in fathoming our selves. To each other, eye to eye, at the self-same intimate scale as each other, we are interesting. To each other.   
   
To each other we seem so complex that we believe ourselves to be causal, outside of mechanical loops.   
   
## Presumption   
   
[humans are interesting because you can just barely understand them](../../www/thought/humans%20are%20interesting%20because%20you%20can%20just%20barely%20understand%20them.md).   
   
Existing at the horizon of our gaze, as familiar yet far as the back of our eyeballs. An itch we can't scratch.   
   
We can only conclude that [humans are automatons](/not_created.md), chaos computing consciousness. That Humans are gods.

## Postscript   
*Plainly spoken*     
Faces are so interesting to look at because they have *just* the amount of complexity your sensing apparatus can process.   
   
Everything we find fascinating we do because it lies *just* on the edge of what we can comprehend.
