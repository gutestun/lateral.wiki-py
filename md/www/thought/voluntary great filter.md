What if the actual [the great filter](../../www/the%20great%20filter.md) is a voluntary one? Upon the realisation of a sufficiently advanced civilisation that it would wreck havoc on the cosmos, it decides to never go interstellar.   
   
At a certain point of maturity a species could decide that their planet is quite nice and focus on achieving homeostasis there.   
   
Caveat: Not really a great filter since they won't exterminate themselves, but just forego interplanetary civilization expansion.   
   
A darker version:     
What if [there is a ceiling to what intelligen life can discover about the universe](../../www/quotes/there%20is%20a%20ceiling%20to%20what%20intelligent%20life%20can%20discover%20about%20the%20universe.md).   
   
It might not be external cosmic causes that hinder humanity from concquering The Cosmic.   
   
It might be their stupidity.   
   
This is a gruesome thought. It's the ultimate [great filter](../../www/the%20great%20filter.md), after the voluntary one.
