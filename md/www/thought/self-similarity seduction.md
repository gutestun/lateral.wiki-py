Turtles all the way down is fine if their shells are distractingly fractal and fractally distracting enough (and fractal distractingly and distracting fractally) to catch and keep our attention, which I just made you loose.   
   
But: [self-similarity is not a sign of complexity](/not_created.md), au contraire.   
   
   
Fractals are fantastic and beautiful and mind-blowing. My [discovery of fractals](/not_created.md) certainly was. But no matter how complex they are, how fascinating, with or without fractal-recognition enhancing neurotransmitter antagonists and agonists slipping by your blood-brain barrier doormen, they are *not* all that amazing.   
   
If you consider life to be amazing. Life has a lot of properties. None of which we so far hav been able to use to define *what life actually is*. But one thing life is *not* is self-similar across scale.   
   
Living systems... ok, beings. Living systems are beings. Let's grant them that. So, one thing that living beings are *not*, is self-similar across scale. The universe at large is (and it is *very, very large*). But living beings?   
   
Well, does your braincell look like your kidney, look like your lymphatic system look like your intestinge look like your skeleton? Not much, no.   
   
[Michael Levin](/not_created.md) argues that for some... the word "thing" will do. For some *thing* to be alive it requires lots of things we don't have a clue about, but one thing it does *not* require is to be self-similar across scale.    
   
Life is not fractal.   
   
In fact, anything that is fractal in nature is not a particularly dynamic system. It's - despite chaos theory - quite stale, sterile and... well, it ends at sterile, doesn't it?
