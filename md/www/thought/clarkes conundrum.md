[q.any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic](/not_created.md) is a classic by Clarke. [anton petrov](/not_created.md) took it further and said that [q.any sufficiently advanced alien species is indistinguishable from nature](/not_created.md).   
   
Whilst thinking about the [problems with the simulation hypothesis](../../www/thought/problems%20with%20the%20simulation%20hypothesis.md) a transposition of this origamied upon me:  [t.any sufficiently advanced computer is indistinguishable from the universe](/not_created.md).   
   
Does this glue [GÃ¶del](/not_created.md) to [Alan Turing](/not_created.md) and negate the diff betwen *in-* and complete?
