The film "God," aired by German broadcaster ARD, poses questions on assisted suicide for a 78-year-old man who has lost the will to live. Over 70% of viewers said doctors should give him access to a lethal drug.   
   
In February, Germany overturned a five-year-old ban on medically assisted suicide, again legalizing the procedure for terminally ill patients.   
   
almost 90% of viewers voted that the military should shoot down a passenger plane carrying 164 people, in order to save 70,000 innocent people in a soccer stadium.
